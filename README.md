# WPFLinkTool

The main purpose of this tool is to save disk space for AC data (can use it for anything but that was the main goal).  
You add your games' `data` folder as an instance, then the tool will calculate the MD5 hash of each file and store it in its `DB` folder along with storing each file's location inside the `data` folder (ex. (`\sound\`, `\movie\`). Each new instance will only add unique files to the `DB`.  
Then you can link your instance to wherever you want and stop copying large amounts of data.
